Welcome to pytorch-datastream's documentation!
==============================================

This is a simple library for creating very readable dataset pipelines and
reusing best practices for issues such as imbalanced datasets. There are
just two components to keep track of: ``Dataset`` and ``Datastream``.

``Dataset`` is a simple mapping between an index and an example. It provides 
pipelining of functions in a very readable syntax originally adapted from
tensorflow 2's ``tf.data.Dataset``.

``Datastream`` combines a ``Dataset`` and a sampler into a stream of examples.
It provides a simple solution to oversampling / stratification, weighted
sampling, and finally converting to a ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``.
